I've always been a tech geek, ever since I was a kid.

My parents couldn't always afford latest tech, but as soon I started working
and getting my own money, I started buying nice stuff. iPads, PlayStations,
MacBooks, iPhones, you name it. These are undeniably great tools. I love my 
Apple Silicon Mac.

You see, I'm not against technology. I recognize there are good tech in the world.
What would be of us without nice trains, without good medicine.
I underwent SRS, do you think I would be so silly as to hate technology?

But... I do. And I hate technologists as well.
This is not a constructive-criticism kind of post, but rather full vitriol.

Of course, fellow programmer â€“ you are pretty much safe from my vitriol.
I don't blame you for doing this shit. You have bills to pay as much as 
I do.

I've always loved computers. Ever since I was a kid I was lured into thinking
that technology would save the world. That working on tech would be so cool.
For a few years, yes! It was. But now I'm hopeless.

I wanted to be Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. I praised Elon. I bite the apple and
the apple bit me.

The thing about hating technology now, being a neo-luddite, technophobe, 
whatever, is that many people tell me to channel my hatred so that it can be used
for the revolution. Or that some people, radical individuals, tell me that 
we can "subvert" tech for good.

I don't want to subvert tech, I don't care if it's good or bad. I'm probably into
some psychosis due to my current mental state so I don't fucking care for any 
logic reasoning (if there's any) about technology!

All I care about is destruction. 

All I care about is vitriol.

I'm descending into psychosis (I don't usually have such delusions). I want to
enjoy the ride. I want something to hate. And that something is tech. Whether it 
be technology itself, AI, techbros, you name it. I hate them.
