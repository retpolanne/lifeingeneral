I'm feeling depressed. 

I've just left the hospital after my bottom-surgery.
This surgery was long awaited, something that I really wanted to do and that have changed my life.
But I can't say, for now, that it has already improved everything.

Surgery was easy for me. No pain, no discomfort,
I was definitely under the effect of anesthesia and 
powerful drugs, so the first day after felt awesome. 

The next few days at the hospital were days where my 
body had to recover the best it could. Pain and discomfort started to appear.
Being able to leave bed for a short few minutes was an adventure.

The big problem is when you have to start to slowly
return to your old life, with your old problems. 

Came back home, my mom is helping me but she is also as debilitated as I am.
Tomorrow, my girlfriend will try to help me as well.

All I want to do is sleep, which is bad for my legs btw. 

I keep crying and feeling weird. 

My best friend left me with a rude, stupid email message.

I kind of wish I have died during the surgery.
