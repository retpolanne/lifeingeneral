I want to disappear. One of the easiest ways to disappear is to kill oneself.
Suicide is not that easy. It's not just a matter of jumping off a building
or in front of the train, but actually a way more complex as oftentimes 
dramatic thing to do. If you die, you die instantly. 

But what about dying slowly? And more important – cleanly.

Last few weeks I've been disconnecting from social media. I now exist in real
life and in a few parts of the internet. My LinkedIn profile is disabled, which
means I barely exist professionally (although people can always hit me up
on Slack). I don't care about being in a community anymore. I wanted to take
care of the people who meant something to me. 

But as I go further in this journey of disconnection, I realize that I'm not 
so important in other people's lives. And that's okay. But I feel sometimes as 
if I'm not being seen, thus I don't exist. 

Do I exist?

I wish I could say "No!", but in reality I do. I'm part of why the world is
trash. I'm part of humanity. I'm a waste of flesh. 

The big problem about being human is that not only you are a waste of flesh, 
but you're also a waste of flesh *with feelings*. And you can hurt your feelings,
and other people's feelings.

It definitely reminds me of the Hedgehog's Dilemma – we feel the need to connect,
but we hurt each other doing so. This is painfully human.

How do I reduce my "social footprint" and avoid hurting myself and other people?
By isolating and letting myself die slowly. Right now I'm organizing my WhatsApp
contacts in a way that almost everyone goes away. I'll just silently disappear
from their lifes, stop bothering them, I'll just be a fading memory.

Then, when no one's left, that's my turn. Hopefully the neighbors will find
out with the putrid-odour my decomposing body will have.

Thank you all.
