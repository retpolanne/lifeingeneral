It's all about taking the easy way out for you, I suppose.

_Content Warning: suicide, vitriol and self-loathing_

{% include spotify-song.html id="6Hlt4S0nm1URyqM0WLlQzY" %}

Once again, I felt suicidal ideation. It's often hard for me to deal with
those feelings, and I often like to go deep into the rabbit hole when this
happens. 

Instead of doing crap such as exercising or mindfulness to get better, I
decided to watch the movie Christine (2016), a biopic about the late journalist 
Christine Chubbuck, who shot herself on live television in 1974.

The movie is quite controversial. In a way, it depicts all the nuances of a
depressed person – being depressed is not the same as being sad all the time, 
or being at all hopeless. In fact, Christine had many goals in her life –
meet someone, get married, have children, be a successful journalist. Not only
that, although she's mostly known for the "world's first televisioned suicide
attempt", she did work on a lot of wholesome pieces of journalism. She was
pretty much against local news sensationalism of blood and guts.

The thing I feel about suicide is that I don't really want to die, but I want
pain, suffering to end, pressure to be released, and ofter a feeling of not 
being able to escape. That does sound like modern life for me in a way.

I pretty much made my mind about suicide being _logical_. It **is** the only
logical option. There can't be another option... or can it?

In some way, yes. Existence is pain. We live in this rotten capitalist economy. 
Of course killing oneself is a great option.

Pro-life people will tell you "hey, life is worth living" – that is bullshit.

But wanna know a good suicide deterrent? **Suicide is harder than you think**
If you mindlessly try any common suicide method, you may end up in a pretty
bad condition – you may survive. If you want to do it properly, you need
research and good luck. If you want to die, you probably *don't* want to
survive...

Given that suicide is hard, how can we actually try to make life a bit bearable?
I have no idea. Understanding yourself, learning about self-compassion, healing
your inner child are things you can do individually to make it a bit bearable for
yourself.

As for this weird world we're living in, many people tell me to organize, to
channel all my anger into action. I agree completely, but we have to keep in
mind that many of us are tired already. If white-priviledged neurotypical 
cishetero men are tired of fighting, can you imagine how we must feel? 
Tired as fuck. So take it easy on us please, be mindful.

I have to be honest – I'm fucking tired of everything. When someone tell me
I have to organize, or that I have to get my ass off that couch and go out to
the streets, it just pushes me to feeling more suicidal. Like hey, y'all 
could've stopped this shit when you had the opportunity. But no, you didn't, 
and now you're blaming *me* for not organizing, not taking action? 

And some people tell me to be strong, that I'm loved, that I'm important, yada
yada, same old bullshit. 

To be honest, fuck Anne. I don't fucking care about anything anymore. I get it
that this self-loathing comes from a bunch of trauma, but understanding trauma
won't fix it. 

Don't tell me pretty words. Don't try to help me. This means *nothing* to me.

I was writing this post with _some_ hope in my head, but now I just feel 
angry. I don't know what to do with this anger. Maybe if should fucking drink
that fucking SN I bought already.

Good bye.

As lazy as I am, I collected a bunch of resources about suicide that I still
haven't read or watched in its entirety. I just want to leave them here for future reference.
