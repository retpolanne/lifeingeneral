Last week I've spent two days on a mental health clinic. I was anxious and feeling extremely suicidal. 

There were a lot of things going on that started making me feel so hopeless. 

## Health in general – and having trouble trusting health professionals

I'm overweight, due to a bunch of circunstances. Being overweight is something that health professionals tend to be really harsh about. 
I used to go to an endocrinologist for my HRT and she started to prescribe Wegovy to me, for weight loss, and she started pressuring me
to exercise and eat better. I understand that it is worrisome to be overweight, but it hurts my trust when someone seems to be sold to the
big pharma and tries to push a very expensive medicine on me.

I also followed up with a nutritionist and it started feeling like I wasn't going anywhere. My problem with food is not just about myself. It's systemical. 
I don't have time to eat well because I have to work, because I lack energy, because I have a lot to do, because I'm autistic. It's not a matter of 
"being mindful" or simply "eating well". It's a matter of changing how we deal with other problems that cause us to not have time to eat better. 

I ditched her. I also ditched my endocrinologist. And my therapist and psychiatrist. It's so hard to find out professionals that are good, that understand
you well, that are anticapitalist and something that I've realized is that I can't seem to find good professinoals that will be covered by insurance. 

I also tried ditching my meds – turns out that left me in a more suicidal state.

I landed on a mental health clinic – a.k.a. mental hospital. It was awful. No phone for hours, a lot of people I didn't know, no windows, no contact 
with the outside world. A prison for mentally ill people. 

Why do they treat mentally ill people like this? Why can't mentally ill people be treated better? I don't understand.

## Friendships that were gone

## Left wing people bullshitting about trans and non-binary people

## Modern life is tiring
