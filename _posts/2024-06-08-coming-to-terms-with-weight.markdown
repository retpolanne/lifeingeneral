Over the course of an year or so, I've earned 22kg. I'm now considered obese class 1 by my BMI. 

I don't feel obese at all. Although I hate sports and often forget to be in movement and to work out, I can't say I'm sedentary. 

I'm definitely overweight, but I feel happy about my body. It's cute, has nice curves, although it's quite round. 

Then why do people keep telling me that I should hate my body? That I should do stuff I don't like? That I may be in danger, and because of that I need to waste money and time with dietitians and physical educators. 

I'm not the one who hates my own body - it's other people that do. They are the ones who keep telling me I'm not healthy and that I shouldn't be happy the way I am.

I try not to listen when people say real workouts are the ones that you do on the gym. Screw that people.

The gym is a toxic environment, where all my physical education trauma come back. I doubt people are judging me, but I can't help but feel like that's the case. 

I try to substitute hitting the gym by maybe playing Wii Sports, Beat Saber, madly dancing in my apartment, going for walks. And that is great! That is fine. But there's always one person who's going to say "this is not a proper workout!". F*ck you if you say that. 

I do what pleases me. I hate it when people try to make me do stuff that is uncomfortable. Fitness is not about pain, but about doing what makes you feel comfortable, activities that are fun and engaging.

I keep referring to this post from FOLX about Health at Every Size when I think about that. [1] - we have to keep in mind that metrics such as the BMI can negatively impact us psychologically. It's not easy being called obese, especially when you don't feel like it. I definitely don't understand it. 


Anyways, I guess I'll just hit the Wii Sports or Beat Saber for now and have fun! Bye.
