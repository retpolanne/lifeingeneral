If you've been following my posts, you probably know that I was struggling
a lot in the last few weeks or so. However, I believe my meds have 
stabilized and I now feel some peace. I feel good, actually.

I thought the Carnival holiday would be triggering for me, but actually 
it wasn't! I found a way to enjoy the holiday without actually going to
parties. 

But most importantly, it's been a few weeks, or even a month or so, that 
I'm pretty much free of social media. The only account I still maintain
is my reddit account, but I don't have the app downloaded on my phone and 
I mainly use the webapp. 

Now, I started noticing some things. Yesterday, I went to the movie
theater to watch "I'm Still Here" (which btw is a great movie!). Before
going to the actual theater, I spent some time reading a bit of Stolen
Focus, by Johann Hari, which is also kind of interesting. 

Today, I went to watch A Complete Unknown (the Bob Dylan biopic) with my
girlfriend. After that, I bought her a LEGO set for her birthday and we
came home to listen to some folk music and talk about music and movies. 
At some point, we even played Sackboy together. 

I didn't know my brain was unfuckable! It actually was!

It's just so great to actually read books, to actually watch movies,
to actually spend time with people you love, to play actual games. 

To enjoy media, and not just consume it or use it as background noise!
