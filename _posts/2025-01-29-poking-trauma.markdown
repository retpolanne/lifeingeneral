_Content warning – this post will talk about complex trauma, suicide
and other sensitive stuff._

I feel anxious. I feel suicidal. And I think I've always felt like this.
Sure, adult life brings us a lot of self-loathing, and I always thought it was
related to my teens – being bullied, being forced into going through the wrong
puberty. 

I sure remember a lot of traumatic events from my teens. But wait – 
I wasn't happy back then, I even felt a lot of self-hatred before. So, something
definitely happened during childhood. 

Recently, I started to realize that I tend to have sex with people especially 
when I don't want to. I often lie saying it was great, I'm often not very sincere.
And it probably happens because I don't care so much about myself. I want to
be used, I want to feel pain, I want to be neglected. I'm trash. 

So, looking back to childhood, a lot of shit happened. First of all, I want
to let it clear that I don't remember being sexually abused. However, I definitely
remember physical and emotional abuse. As a young kid, I would often tell my
parents that I didn't want to be born, or that I wanted to die. 

I remember a specific occasion where I saw a very disturbing video on YouTube with 
my cousins. After I realized I was traumatized, I went to my mom, crying, 
saying that I wanted to die. She comforted me. I felt cold shivers. I was
shaking. My dad came back from work that day and completely neglected my emotions. 
He didn't comfort me, he didn't seem to care. 

My dad was highly negligent. Often times, abusive. He didn't care so much about
my emotions. Even though I seemed very autistic, he never cared for taking me
to a therapist. When my cousin would hurt me, he would tell me to punch back and
stop crying. He would spank me quite often when I misbehaved. 

In 2023, I had an interesting conversation with him, when I told him that he 
was negligent – he tried to gaslight me, saying that he always worried about me. 
What a liar. A scumbag.
